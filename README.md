## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

First time wrote responsive design, particularly "min-width" tag and width in percentages.

### Continued development

Though responsible design works fine on mobile phone,
Only little amount of attributes was used. 
Need more training on this.
